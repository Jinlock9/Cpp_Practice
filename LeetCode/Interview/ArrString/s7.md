# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0; 

        int minPrice = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            minPrice = min(minPrice, prices[i]);
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minPrice);
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```
