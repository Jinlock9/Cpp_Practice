# Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence
A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` *if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return* `false`.

#### Constraints:
- `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`

## Solution
```cpp
bool canMakeArithmeticProgression(vector<int>& arr) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int diff = arr[1] - arr[0]; 
    for (size_t i = 2; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
        if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != diff) {
            return false; 
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
