# Merge Strings Alternately
You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the *merged string*.

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
```cpp
string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
    string merged;
    int len1 = word1.length(), len2 = word2.length();
    int i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < len1 && j < len2) {
        merged.push_back(word1[i++]);
        merged.push_back(word2[j++]);
    }

    if (i < len1) merged.append(word1.substr(i));
    if (j < len2) merged.append(word2.substr(j));

    return merged;
}
```
