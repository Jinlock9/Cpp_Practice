# Baseball Game
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer `x`: Record a new score of `x`.
- `'+'`: Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- `'D'`: Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- `'C'`: Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return *the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations*.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= operations.length <= 1000`
- `operations[i]` is `"C"`, `"D"`, `"+"`, or a string representing an integer in the range `[-3 * 10^4, 3 * 10^4]`.
- For operation `"+"`, there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
- For operations `"C"` and `"D"`, there will always be at least one previous score on the record.

## Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int calPoints(vector<string>& operations) {
        std::vector<int> buf;
        
        for (const std::string& op : operations) {
            if (op == "+") {
                if (buf.size() >= 2) {
                    buf.push_back(buf[buf.size() - 1] + buf[buf.size() - 2]);
                }
            } else if (op == "D") {
                if (!buf.empty()) {
                    buf.push_back(2 * buf.back());
                }
            } else if (op == "C") {
                if (!buf.empty()) {
                    buf.pop_back();
                }
            } else {
                buf.push_back(std::stoi(op));
            }
        }

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i : buf) {
            sum += i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
